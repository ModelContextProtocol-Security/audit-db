# Finding: Credential Exposure Risk

**Finding ID**: high-001-credential-exposure  
**Severity**: High  
**Category**: Authentication & Authorization  
**CWE**: CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials)  
**CVSS Score**: 7.5 (High)

## Executive Summary
Notion integration tokens are stored in environment variables, creating potential exposure risks through process memory access, container escapes, and system compromises.

## Technical Description
The server supports two credential configuration methods:
1. `NOTION_TOKEN` environment variable (recommended approach)  
2. `OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS` environment variable (JSON string format)

While environment variables are a common pattern, they present security risks in containerized and multi-tenant environments where process memory or environment variable access could lead to credential exposure.

## Evidence
**Code Location**: `src/openapi-mcp-server/mcp/proxy.ts` lines 88-106

```typescript
private parseHeadersFromEnv(): Record<string, string> {
  // First try OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS (existing behavior)
  const headersJson = process.env.OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS
  if (headersJson) {
    try {
      const headers = JSON.parse(headersJson)
      // ... headers processing ...
      return headers
    }
    // ... error handling ...
  }

  // Alternative: try NOTION_TOKEN  
  const notionToken = process.env.NOTION_TOKEN
  if (notionToken) {
    return {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${notionToken}`,
      'Notion-Version': '2022-06-28'
    }
  }
  return {}
}
```

## Impact Assessment
- **Confidentiality**: High - Full Notion workspace access if token compromised
- **Integrity**: High - Ability to modify pages, databases, and content
- **Availability**: Medium - Potential for workspace disruption
- **Exploitability**: Medium - Requires process or container access
- **Scope**: Complete connected Notion workspace

## Affected Components
- File: `src/openapi-mcp-server/mcp/proxy.ts` (lines 88-106)
- Function: `parseHeadersFromEnv()`
- Environment variables: `NOTION_TOKEN`, `OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS`
- Docker deployment: Environment variable exposure in containers

## Reproduction Steps
1. Deploy server with `NOTION_TOKEN=ntn_secret123...`
2. Access container or process environment: `docker exec container_id env | grep NOTION`
3. OR access process memory: `cat /proc/PID/environ | grep NOTION`
4. Extracted token provides full Notion API access

## Risk Scenarios

**Container Escape Scenario**:
- Attacker gains container access through vulnerability
- Environment variables accessible via `/proc/1/environ`
- Full Notion workspace compromise

**Process Memory Disclosure**:
- System compromise or privilege escalation
- Environment variables visible in process listings
- Long-lived tokens increase exposure window

**Multi-tenant Environment**:
- Shared infrastructure with insufficient isolation
- Environment variable leakage between tenants
- Cross-tenant data access

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
- [ ] Configure network isolation for deployments
- [ ] Use read-only Notion tokens where possible
- [ ] Implement token rotation procedures
- [ ] Add environment variable security warnings to documentation

### Short-term Improvements
- [ ] Implement secure credential storage integration (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- [ ] Add support for credential files with proper file permissions (600)
- [ ] Implement token caching with memory protection
- [ ] Add credential validation and health checks

### Long-term Strategic Changes
- [ ] Develop OAuth 2.0 integration for dynamic token management
- [ ] Implement credential rotation automation
- [ ] Add integration with enterprise credential management systems
- [ ] Develop security hardening documentation

## Remediation Validation
**Testing Steps**:
1. Implement secure credential storage
2. Verify tokens not accessible via environment dump
3. Test token rotation functionality
4. Validate access controls with least-privilege tokens

**Success Criteria**:
- Credentials not visible in process environment
- Token rotation working without service interruption
- Monitoring alerts on credential access attempts

## Auditor Notes
This finding represents a balance between usability and security. Environment variables are the standard deployment pattern for many applications, but the sensitive nature of Notion workspace access warrants additional security measures. The recommended mitigations focus on defense-in-depth rather than completely eliminating environment variable usage.
