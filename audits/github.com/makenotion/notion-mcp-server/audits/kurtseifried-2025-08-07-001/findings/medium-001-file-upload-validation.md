# Finding: File Upload Path Validation

**Finding ID**: medium-001-file-upload-validation  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Category**: Input Validation  
**CWE**: CWE-22 (Path Traversal)  
**CVSS Score**: 6.1 (Medium)

## Executive Summary
File upload functionality accepts user-provided file paths without sufficient validation, potentially enabling path traversal attacks or unauthorized file access in certain deployment scenarios.

## Technical Description
The HTTP client implementation processes file upload parameters by directly reading user-specified file paths using `fs.createReadStream()`. While this is intended for legitimate file uploads to Notion, insufficient path validation could allow attackers to specify unauthorized file paths.

## Evidence
**Code Location**: `src/openapi-mcp-server/client/http-client.ts` lines 42-65

```typescript
private async prepareFileUpload(operation: OpenAPIV3.OperationObject, params: Record<string, any>): Promise<FormData | null> {
  const fileParams = isFileUploadParameter(operation)
  if (fileParams.length === 0) return null

  const formData = new FormData()

  // Handle file uploads
  for (const param of fileParams) {
    const filePath = params[param]
    if (!filePath) {
      throw new Error(`File path must be provided for parameter: ${param}`)
    }
    // ... handling logic ...
    function addFile(name: string, filePath: string) {
      try {
        const fileStream = fs.createReadStream(filePath)  // ‚Üê Direct path usage
        formData.append(name, fileStream)
      } catch (error) {
        throw new Error(`Failed to read file at ${filePath}: ${error}`)
      }
    }
  }
  return formData
}
```

## Impact Assessment
- **Confidentiality**: Medium - Potential unauthorized file access
- **Integrity**: Low - Read-only access, no file modification
- **Availability**: Low - DoS potential through invalid paths
- **Exploitability**: Medium - Requires crafted MCP tool calls
- **Scope**: Files accessible to the server process user

## Affected Components
- File: `src/openapi-mcp-server/client/http-client.ts` (lines 42-65)
- Function: `prepareFileUpload()` and `addFile()`
- All file upload operations in Notion API (e.g., image attachments)
- MCP tools that accept file path parameters

## Reproduction Steps
1. Identify MCP tool that accepts file parameters (e.g., image upload)
2. Craft malicious file path: `../../../etc/passwd` or `C:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\SAM`
3. Execute MCP tool call with malicious path parameter
4. Observe server attempts to read unauthorized files
5. Error messages may reveal file system structure or access permissions

## Risk Scenarios

**Path Traversal Attack**:
- Attacker crafts tool call with `../../secret-files/credentials.json`
- Server attempts to read file outside intended directory
- Sensitive configuration or credential files exposed
- Information disclosure through error messages

**Development Environment Exposure**:
- Developer workstation runs MCP server with broad file access
- AI agent compromised or tricked into reading system files
- Source code, SSH keys, or environment files accessible
- Privilege escalation through credential discovery

**Container Escape Attempt**:
- Container deployment with mounted volumes
- Path traversal attempts to access host file system
- `/proc/` filesystem access for system information gathering
- Potential container breakout reconnaissance

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
- [ ] Implement file path validation and sanitization
- [ ] Restrict file access to designated safe directories
- [ ] Add path traversal detection and blocking
- [ ] Enhance error handling to prevent information disclosure

### Short-term Improvements
- [ ] Implement configurable file upload restrictions
- [ ] Add file type and size validation
- [ ] Create secure upload directory management
- [ ] Implement file access logging and monitoring

### Long-term Strategic Changes
- [ ] Develop secure file handling framework
- [ ] Add sandboxing for file operations
- [ ] Implement comprehensive input validation library
- [ ] Create security testing for all file operations

## Remediation Examples

**Path Validation Implementation**:
```typescript
import path from 'path';

function validateFilePath(filePath: string, allowedBasePath: string): string {
  // Resolve and normalize paths
  const resolvedPath = path.resolve(filePath);
  const resolvedBasePath = path.resolve(allowedBasePath);
  
  // Check if path is within allowed directory
  if (!resolvedPath.startsWith(resolvedBasePath)) {
    throw new Error('File path outside allowed directory');
  }
  
  // Additional checks for suspicious patterns
  if (filePath.includes('..') || filePath.includes('~')) {
    throw new Error('Invalid file path characters');
  }
  
  return resolvedPath;
}
```

**Configuration-based Restrictions**:
```typescript
const UPLOAD_CONFIG = {
  allowedDirectories: ['/tmp/mcp-uploads', './user-files'],
  maxFileSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024, // 10MB
  allowedExtensions: ['.jpg', '.png', '.pdf', '.txt']
};
```

## Remediation Validation
**Testing Steps**:
1. Implement path validation logic
2. Test with legitimate file paths - should succeed
3. Test with path traversal attempts - should be blocked
4. Verify error messages don't reveal system information
5. Test with various file system edge cases

**Success Criteria**:
- Path traversal attempts blocked and logged
- Legitimate file operations function normally
- Error messages provide minimal system information
- File access restricted to designated directories

## Auditor Notes
This finding represents a moderate risk that increases significantly in certain deployment scenarios. The current implementation follows common Node.js patterns but lacks defense-in-depth for file system access. The risk is mitigated by the fact that this is primarily intended for legitimate file uploads, but security-conscious deployments should implement additional protections.
