# Finding: Network Exposure Risk

**Finding ID**: high-002-network-exposure  
**Severity**: High  
**Category**: Network Security  
**CWE**: CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information)  
**CVSS Score**: 7.3 (High)

## Executive Summary
The HTTP transport mode binds to `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces) by default, potentially exposing the MCP server to public networks and increasing attack surface beyond intended localhost or private network access.

## Technical Description
When configured for HTTP transport, the server binds to all available network interfaces (`0.0.0.0`) rather than restricting access to localhost (`127.0.0.1`) or specific private interfaces. This creates unintended network exposure that could allow remote access to the MCP server.

## Evidence
**Code Location**: `scripts/start-server.ts` lines 147-151

```typescript
app.listen(port, '0.0.0.0', () => {
  console.log(`MCP Server listening on port ${port}`)
  console.log(`Endpoint: http://0.0.0.0:${port}/mcp`)
  console.log(`Health check: http://0.0.0.0:${port}/health`)
  console.log(`Authentication: Bearer token required`)
})
```

**Docker Configuration**: The Dockerfile exposes the service without network restrictions, relying on external configuration for access control.

## Impact Assessment
- **Confidentiality**: High - Notion workspace data accessible over network
- **Integrity**: High - Remote modification capabilities via exposed API
- **Availability**: Medium - Potential for denial of service attacks
- **Exploitability**: High - Network accessible without additional controls
- **Scope**: All connected Notion workspaces and MCP functionality

## Affected Components
- File: `scripts/start-server.ts` (lines 147-151)
- Function: Express app listener configuration
- Docker deployment: Network exposure in containerized environments
- HTTP transport mode: All network interfaces bound by default

## Reproduction Steps
1. Start server in HTTP mode: `notion-mcp-server --transport http --port 3000`
2. Verify binding: `netstat -tlnp | grep 3000` shows `0.0.0.0:3000`
3. Test remote access: `curl http://[server-ip]:3000/health` succeeds from external networks
4. With valid bearer token, full MCP API access available remotely

## Risk Scenarios

**Public Cloud Deployment**:
- Server deployed to cloud instance with public IP
- MCP endpoint accessible from internet
- Brute force attacks against bearer token authentication
- Unauthorized access to Notion workspaces

**Corporate Network Exposure**:
- Server deployed on workstation or development machine
- Corporate firewall allows internal network access
- Lateral movement potential for compromised internal systems
- Unintended access to sensitive workspace data

**Container Orchestration**:
- Kubernetes/Docker deployment with service exposure
- Misconfigured ingress controllers or service meshes
- Network policies not properly restricting access
- Cross-cluster or cross-namespace access potential

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
- [ ] Configure network binding to specific interfaces in production
- [ ] Implement firewall rules restricting access to MCP port
- [ ] Add network security guidance to deployment documentation
- [ ] Recommend reverse proxy configuration for production use

### Short-term Improvements
- [ ] Add configuration option for bind address (`--bind-address` parameter)
- [ ] Implement built-in IP whitelisting/access control
- [ ] Add network security warnings in HTTP transport mode
- [ ] Provide secure deployment examples and templates

### Long-term Strategic Changes
- [ ] Default to localhost binding with explicit configuration for broader access
- [ ] Implement service discovery integration for controlled network access
- [ ] Add TLS/SSL support for encrypted HTTP transport
- [ ] Develop network security best practices guide

## Remediation Examples

**Secure Binding Configuration**:
```bash
# Bind to localhost only
notion-mcp-server --transport http --bind-address 127.0.0.1

# Bind to specific private interface  
notion-mcp-server --transport http --bind-address 10.0.1.100
```

**Firewall Rules (iptables)**:
```bash
# Allow only local subnet access
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3000 -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3000 -j DROP
```

**Nginx Reverse Proxy**:
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name mcp.example.com;
    
    location /mcp {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        proxy_set_header Authorization $http_authorization;
    }
}
```

## Remediation Validation
**Testing Steps**:
1. Configure restricted binding address
2. Verify `netstat` shows correct interface binding
3. Test remote access is blocked from external networks
4. Confirm legitimate local access still functions

**Success Criteria**:
- Network binding restricted to intended interfaces
- External network access blocked
- Internal/authorized access functioning normally
- Security monitoring alerts on connection attempts

## Auditor Notes
This finding highlights the importance of secure-by-default configuration. While authentication is required, the broad network exposure increases attack surface unnecessarily. The risk is particularly acute in cloud and containerized deployments where network topology may not be immediately obvious to operators.
