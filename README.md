# Audit Database (audit-db)

**Community-maintained database of MCP server audit results and security assessments. Contains structured audit findings, compliance reports, and security ratings to help organizations evaluate MCP server safety and make informed deployment decisions.**

## Overview

The Audit Database is a transparent, community-driven repository of comprehensive MCP server audits. Unlike traditional vulnerability databases that only report final conclusions, this database emphasizes complete transparency by requiring full audit methodology, supporting evidence, and reproducible findings.

Every audit entry must provide sufficient detail for independent verification and reproduction, including the prompts used, reasoning processes, supporting evidence, and complete methodology. This transparency ensures that audit findings can be validated, challenged, and improved by the community, creating a trusted foundation for MCP server security assessments.

## Core Principles

### Transparency First
- **Open Methodology**: All audit approaches, prompts, and reasoning must be fully documented
- **Evidence-Based**: Every finding must be supported by concrete evidence and reproduction steps
- **Process Documentation**: Complete audit conversations and decision-making processes should be included
- **No Black Box Results**: Simple "good" or "bad" conclusions without supporting rationale are not acceptable

### Reproducibility Requirements
- **Open Source Targets**: Only audits of open source MCP servers are accepted to ensure reproducible analysis
- **Detailed Steps**: All audit procedures must be documented with sufficient detail for reproduction
- **Version Specificity**: Audits must specify exact versions, commits, or releases of audited servers
- **Environment Documentation**: Testing environments and configurations must be clearly documented
- **Future Validation**: Reproducible audits enable future re-auditing to verify if identified problems have been fixed

### Community Validation
- **Peer Review**: Audit submissions undergo community review and validation
- **Challenge Process**: Mechanisms for questioning and refining audit findings
- **Iterative Improvement**: Support for updated audits as servers evolve and improve
- **Quality Standards**: Consistent standards for audit quality and completeness

## Audit Entry Requirements

### Mandatory Components

#### 1. Audit Overview
- **Target Server**: Name, version, repository URL, and specific commit hash
- **Audit Purpose**: Objective and scope of the audit (security, functionality, compliance)
- **Auditor Information**: Contributor identity and relevant expertise
- **Audit Date**: When the audit was conducted
- **Methodology**: High-level approach and frameworks used

#### 2. Audit Process Documentation
- **Initial Prompts**: Starting prompts and instructions used to begin the audit
- **Conversation Transcripts**: Complete or substantial portions of audit conversations
- **Decision Points**: Key decision-making moments and rationale
- **Tool Usage**: Any automated tools or scripts used during the audit
- **Environmental Setup**: Testing environment and configuration details

#### 3. Findings and Evidence
- **Specific Findings**: Detailed description of each finding with severity classification
- **Supporting Evidence**: Code snippets, screenshots, logs, or other proof of findings
- **Reproduction Steps**: Complete steps needed to reproduce each finding
- **Impact Assessment**: Analysis of potential impact and exploitability
- **Remediation Guidance**: Specific recommendations for addressing findings

#### 4. Validation and Quality
- **Testing Evidence**: Proof that claimed functionality was actually tested
- **False Positive Analysis**: Discussion of potential false positives and validation steps
- **Limitations**: Acknowledgment of audit scope limitations and areas not covered
- **Confidence Levels**: Auditor confidence in various findings and assessments

### Optional but Encouraged Components

#### 5. Extended Documentation
- **Complete Conversations**: Full audit conversations when context allows
- **Research Notes**: Background research and preliminary analysis
- **Comparative Analysis**: Comparison with similar servers or alternatives
- **Follow-up Actions**: Planned or recommended follow-up audits or improvements

#### 6. Community Engagement
- **Response to Feedback**: Auditor responses to community questions and challenges
- **Updates and Revisions**: Revised findings based on community input
- **Cross-References**: Links to related audits or vulnerability reports
- **Discussion Links**: References to relevant community discussions

## Repository Structure

**TBD** - Database organization and structure to be determined based on implementation requirements.

## Process Improvement and Tool Integration

### Audit Methodology Evolution
As the community contributes audits and develops better techniques, these improvements must be integrated back into the broader ecosystem:

- **mcpserver-audit Integration**: Successful audit methodologies and techniques discovered through community contributions should be incorporated into the mcpserver-audit tool
- **Tool Enhancement**: Automated tools and scripts that prove effective in community audits should be integrated into the audit tool suite
- **Standard Development**: Quality standards and best practices developed through community experience should be formalized in the audit tooling
- **Feedback Loop**: The audit database serves as a testing ground for new audit approaches that can then be systematized and automated

This ensures that the manual audit efforts in the database continuously improve the automated audit capabilities, creating a virtuous cycle of security assessment enhancement.

## Quality Standards

### Audit Quality Criteria

#### Completeness
