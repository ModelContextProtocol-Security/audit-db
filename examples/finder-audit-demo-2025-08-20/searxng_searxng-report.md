```yaml
# docker-compose.yml for MCP backend
services:
  searxng:
    image: searxng/searxng:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/
      - INSTANCE_NAME=mcp-backend
    volumes:
      - ./searxng:/etc/searxng
```

**2. Security Configuration for MCP Use:**
```yaml
# searxng/settings.yml
server:
  secret_key: "your-secret-key-here"
  limiter: true
  public_instance: false
  
search:
  safe_search: 1
  autocomplete: ""
  
ui:
  static_use_hash: true
